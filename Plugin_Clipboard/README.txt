Windows Clipboard Plugin for Volatility 3
=========================================

OVERVIEW
========
Memory forensics plugin that extracts Windows clipboard data from memory dumps.
Recovers text content that users copied to the clipboard, including passwords, URLs, emails, and other sensitive information.

HOW IT WORKS
============
1. Scans memory for Windows clipboard format headers (CF_TEXT, CF_UNICODETEXT, CF_OEMTEXT)
2. Extracts clipboard content based on format type and encoding
3. Searches for high-value user content patterns (passwords, emails, URLs)
4. Validates data to filter out system noise and false positives
5. Removes duplicates and sorts by user content relevance

SETUP
=====
Copy clipboard.py to your Volatility 3 plugins directory:
volatility3/volatility3/plugins/windows/clipboard.py

USAGE (please use the provided memory_dump.raw file at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHoPUyLAOd0BkFVNcNmBaDrrU4d5V12d/view?usp=sharing)
